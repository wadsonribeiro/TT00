/// The old app had four modes: SteamTools, OpenSteamTools (upstream OST, but *displayed* as
/// "BetterSteamTools"), OpenSteamToolsNightly (displayed "BetterSteamTools Nightly") and a
/// CloudRedirect CLI fix. The two BetterSteamTools-branded ones become <see cref="UnlockerMode.Bst"/>.
/// That's the name those users chose and it's still the name of what they get. SteamTools and
/// CloudRedirect are gone with no successor, so those users are reset to "no mode" and re-onboarded.
///
/// <para><b>Why this is safe to run on every launch.</b> None of the legacy strings parse as a current
/// enum member, so "unparseable" is an exact synonym for "written by an older build". A user already
/// on Ost/Bst/Custom parses fine and is left completely alone, which is why no persisted
/// has-migrated marker is needed. This property is the entire reason the enum members are named
/// Ost/Bst/Custom: had <c>OpenSteamTools</c> been reused for the nightly channel, every legacy
/// stable-OST user would have silently parsed into the wrong mode, and the migration would have had
/// no way to tell those users apart from legitimate post-migration ones.</para>
