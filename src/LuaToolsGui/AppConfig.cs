    //     crack from here; the user does everything in their own window.

    //     it (no hostpolicy/coreclr/System.Private.CoreLib, no includedFrameworks), so the .NET 10
    //     DESKTOP runtime must be present. We install it on demand via Velopack's Runtimes API.
    //   * Its zip has a real directory TREE (Goldberg/, TEMP/ beside the exe), unlike the flat zip
