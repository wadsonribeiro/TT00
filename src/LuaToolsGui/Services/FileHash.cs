/// Used to prove a file on disk is still the one a fix wrote. SHA-256 rather than something faster
/// because it is in the BCL (no dependency), hardware-accelerated on every CPU this app targets
/// (measured ~2.1 GB/s here), and only ever runs over the handful of files a fix actually touches —
/// never the whole game. Disk read dominates, so a cheaper hash would buy nothing measurable.

/// Null on failure, never an exception: a locked or vanished file must degrade to "cannot verify" and
/// let the caller decide, not abort a revert halfway.
